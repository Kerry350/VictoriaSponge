VictoriaSponge
==============

This is just a bit of fun for now. VictoriaSponge is a super lightweight DOM selection and manipulation library. My hope is to use this when jQuery is just that little bit too heavy. 

That's not to knock jQuery in any way, not at all, but when you're only looking for a very small subset of it's functionality it makes sense to use something smaller.

I thought this would also be a pretty fun learning experience. 

It's named VictoriaSponge due to victoria sponges being incredibly simple, and yet still amazingly delicious.
